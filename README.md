#Functional __C#__
This is the code repository for [Functional C#](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/functional-c?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=9781785282225&utm_medium=repository), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##About the Book
Functional programming makes your application faster, improves performance, and increases your productivity. C# code is written at a higher level of abstraction, so that code will be closer to business requirements, abstracting away many low-level implementation details.

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:

```
namespace ActionFuncDelegates
{
    public partial class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //ActionDelegateInvoke();
            FuncDelegateInvoke();
        }
    }
```
